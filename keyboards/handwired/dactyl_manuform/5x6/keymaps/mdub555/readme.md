![Dactyl Manuform 5x6]()

# Mdub555's Custom Dactyl Manuform Layout

This keymap has four layers:
* A standard qwerty layer
* A 10 key numpad layer
* A movement layer that contains the arrow keys and can control the mouse
* A gaming layer that shifts the keys over one so WASD lines up with the home row
